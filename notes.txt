todo app assign user to user using their id

user to user task: user can create task to another user using their unique ID

Sure! Here's the explanation in note form without the code:

### Key Concepts:

1. **Users**:

   * Each user has a **unique ID** and a **name**.
   * Users can create and assign tasks to other users using their ID.

2. **Tasks**:

   * Tasks have an **ID**, a **description**, and a reference to the **assigned user’s ID**.
   * Tasks can have a **completion status** (e.g., "Pending" or "Completed").
   * Tasks can be **reassigned** to other users by updating the assigned user ID.

3. **Task Assignment Process**:

   * A user (e.g., Alice) can create a task and assign it to another user (e.g., Bob) by specifying Bob’s unique ID.
   * Tasks can also be reassigned later, where the **assigned user’s ID** is updated to a new user.

4. **TodoApp**:

   * The app keeps track of **users** and **tasks**.
   * Users are added to the system using their unique ID and name.
   * Tasks are created with an ID, description, and the **assigned user’s ID**.
   * A task can be **reassigned** by updating the assigned user’s ID.
   * The app allows viewing of all tasks, including their status (pending/completed) and the user they are assigned to.

### Process Flow:

1. **Adding Users**:

   * Add users to the system by specifying a unique **user ID** and **name**.

2. **Creating Tasks**:

   * A user can create a task with a **task ID**, **description**, and assign it to another user by specifying that user’s **unique ID**.

3. **Reassigning Tasks**:

   * Tasks can be reassigned to other users by updating the **assigned user ID**.

4. **Viewing Tasks**:

   * The system allows viewing all tasks, including the task description, assigned user ID, and completion status.

5. **Task Status**:

   * Tasks have a status that shows whether they are **pending** or **completed**. Users can mark tasks as completed.

### Example Use Case:

1. **Add Users**:

   * Alice (ID 1) and Bob (ID 2) are added to the system.

2. **Create Task**:

   * Alice creates a task with ID 101, description "Complete project report", and assigns it to Bob (ID 2).

3. **Reassign Task**:

   * Later, Alice decides to reassign the task to herself, so the task’s assigned user ID is changed to Alice’s ID (1).

4. **View Tasks**:

   * All tasks in the system can be viewed, showing the task ID, description, assigned user ID, and whether it is completed or pending.

### Notes:

* **Task Assignment**: Users can assign tasks to other users using their unique ID. This makes task management more structured, especially in collaborative environments.
* **Task Reassignment**: The flexibility to reassign tasks allows users to adjust workloads or reassign tasks to the appropriate person.
* **Task Completion**: Tasks can be marked as completed, which helps track progress.

This structure can be expanded with additional features like task priorities, deadlines, or notifications. You can also implement a more advanced system where users are notified when a task is assigned or completed.
